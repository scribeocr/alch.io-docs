[^next-word]: The "next word" (selected with `Tab`) is selected based on what Alch believes the reading order is.  After reaching the end of a line, the `Tab` shortcut will jump to whatever it believes the next line in the document is, whereas `ArrowRight` will go to the word visually to the right (if any).  The "next word" can be unpredictable for documents without an unambiguous reading order--for example, data tables or documents with many floating elements.
